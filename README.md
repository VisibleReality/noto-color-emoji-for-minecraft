# Noto Color Emoji for Minecraft

Adds 72x72px color emoji for 1426 single-character emoji, using Google's [Noto Color Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji).

Multi-character emoji, such as flags and other emoji using zero-width joiner (ZWJ) sequences are not supported, due to limitations with Minecraft's bitmap text rendering. The ZWJ character is hidden, to prevent dotted boxes from displaying when a multi-character emoji is used.

Due to how Minecraft colors text, the emoji will only render correctly when the text color is white.
